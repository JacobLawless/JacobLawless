- Greetings, I’m the freshly graduated @JacobLawless

- My interests lie in many fields, really. I like to keep myself busy with different hobbies. 

- With a computer engineering degree, I’m still teaching myself many things since I only achieved 
  a bachelor’s. For instance, programming is still something I am a bit unfamiliar with when it 
   comes to differences of languages and database junk like SQL. 
   
- Collaboration is cool, so if anyone wants my eager mits on their code or want to peck my brain 
  about ideas, give me a ring.
